while in barebone = loop in C
(incr variable) in barebones = (variable + 1) in C
(decr variable) in barebones = (variable - 1) in C
(clear variable) in barebones = (variable = 0) in C

bai 5:



bai 6:

input: X
output: Z

i will explain the program line by line:
in line1 we have 'clear z', and we will recive the result is z = 0
in line 2 we have a 'while' statement and the loop depend on value of X, in this case i will give value 3 for X
Loop 1: because x = 3 not 0 so we will do:
		z will increase one unit and become z = 1
		z will incease one unit and become z = 2
		x will decrease one unit and become x = 2
Loop 2 because x = 2 not 0 so we will do:
		z will increase one unit and become z = 3
		z will increase one unit and become z = 4
		x will decrease one unit and become x = 1
Loop 3: because x = 1 not 0 so we will do:
		z will increase one unit and become z = 4
		z will increase one unit and become z = 5
		x will decrease one unit and become x = 0
Loop 4: because x = 0 so the 'while' statement is end

so we have the result is z = 5
